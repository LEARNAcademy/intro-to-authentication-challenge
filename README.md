# intro-to-authentication-challenge

## Getting Started

### Clone the Rails API

We have created a rails backend app with Devise authentication already hooked up. We will go though all the steps of setting up a rails app with Devise later.

For now, go to this repo:

<a href="https://github.com/2018-Delta/example-auth-backend" target="_blank">example-auth-backend</a>

Clone the repo and start the app. Remember all the steps for setting up a rails app!

### Clone the React App

We have also created the beginnings of a React front end with a registration page. It is already set to work with the rails api.

Go to the frontend repo <a href="https://github.com/2018-Delta/example-auth-frontend" target="_blank">example-auth-frontend</a>

Clone the repo and start the app. Remember all the steps for setting up a React app!

### Get Aquainted

Take a few moments to look through the React app and the register page. Check to see if you can follow the path of authentication
